# 8. Web Application Attacks

Explored common vulnerabilities in web applications through hands-on labs.

## Completed Labs
- Used SQL injection to retrieve data and bypass authentication.
- Demonstrated stored and reflected XSS payloads that hijack sessions.
- Crafted CSRF proofs of concept to test token protections.

## Write-ups
- [Lab Notes](lab_notes.md) â€“ observations and payloads from each exercise.

## Lessons Learned
- Input validation and context-aware encoding are critical defenses.
- Regular assessments help uncover logic flaws before attackers do.
