# Web Application Attack Lab Notes

- Practiced SQL injection on a test environment to bypass authentication and extract user data.
- Exploited stored and reflected XSS to demonstrate session hijacking risks.
- Tested CSRF defenses by crafting malicious forms and verifying token validation.

These exercises reinforced secure coding practices and the value of thorough input validation.
